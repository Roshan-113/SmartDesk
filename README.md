# 🚀 SmartDesk – Service Request & Ticketing System

## 📌 Overview

SmartDesk is a modern **Service Request & Ticketing System** built using a MERN-style architecture.
It helps organizations efficiently manage, track, and resolve service tickets.

This project focuses on:

* Scalable frontend using React
* Structured backend using Node.js & Express
* Database operations using PostgreSQL

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Managing service requests manually leads to:

* Lack of tracking
* Delayed responses
* Poor accountability

SmartDesk solves this by providing a centralized system for ticket creation, tracking, and resolution.

---

## 💡 Solution

SmartDesk allows users to:

* Create service tickets
* Track ticket status (Open → In Progress → Closed)
* Assign priorities (High / Medium / Low)
* Filter and search tickets
* View analytics through dashboard

---

# 🧠 System Architecture

## 🔷 Frontend (React)

Handles UI, user interaction, and API communication.

### Responsibilities:

* UI Components (Dashboard, Ticket List, Forms)
* Routing (React Router)
* State Management (Hooks / Context API)
* API Calls (fetch/axios)
* Form handling & validation

---

## 🔷 Backend (Node.js + Express)

Handles business logic and API endpoints.

### Responsibilities:

* REST API creation
* Request validation
* Business logic handling
* Database operations

---

## 🔷 Database (PostgreSQL)

Stores structured ticket data.

### Example Table: `tickets`

```sql
CREATE TABLE tickets (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255),
  description TEXT,
  priority VARCHAR(50),
  status VARCHAR(50),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
